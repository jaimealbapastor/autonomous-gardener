# Session 8

This session's activity was to redesign the main pivot's piece.  

I wished to use the Trellis method to remove useless material.
By doing this, impression time and weight will be decreased while maintaining the same resistance to forces.

I emailed our mechanical teacher over the weekend to receive advice. During the session, he stopped by to visit me, and we talked about several things to do better at:

- First, despite being fashionable, the curved area offers no advantages for managing moments of force.
- Next, the line joining the outside ones should point toward the axis's center.
- Finally, a single cross can replace the two central crosses. For the kinds of forces used in the piece, this structure is adequate.

The final result of the piece:

At the end of the session I started the 3d impression of the piece.
