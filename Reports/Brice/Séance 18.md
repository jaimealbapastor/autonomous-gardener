## Rapports de séance Brice Mabille

- 27/03/2023 : Setup du projet GitHub partagé

# Séance 18

During this session, I firstly worked on the GPS Module. 

It took me time because I had to make pins on the electronic cable.

I found the code on internet and when I went outside, the GPS worked well. 

The code is in the github in the GPS file.

I verified if the longitude and latitude were the right coordinates.

Then I spoke with the robot club man to show to him how the robot works.

For the next session I will link the servo to ensure a well movement system.
