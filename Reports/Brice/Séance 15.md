Drilling system

One size of the box re-built with holes to link the stepper and enter the electronics

Joined the box's sides 

Print the link again for the extremity of the endless screw

Cut the stems to have the right size with the box

I joined some squares to put in the frame.

Next session, I will cut a hole in the frame to join the drilling system in the robot.
